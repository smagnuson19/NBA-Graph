# Interactive NBA Stat Checker

### Overview
 This web application can take a Player Name of someone in the NBA and then create a bar chart of the stats that they recorded broken up by game. The chart is responsive and the name of the opponent will show up once the user hovers over the bar.

### Who Did What?
Scott Magnuson and Jed Rosen shared the programming responsibilities and initial research efforts equally. Both brainstormed ways to improve the implementation.

### What did we Learn?
We learned how to use various Python libraries to implement a responsive front end.

We Used:
* Flask web framework, version 0.12.2
* Bokeh data visualization library, version 0.12.5
* pandas data structures and analysis library, version 0.20.1
* The python NBA api

### Where do we take this?
In the future, I think the basic framework of this project could be used to easily create visualizations for certain media outlets so I think that we could take an aspect of to our final project. Unfortunately efforts to color code the bars based on opponents could not be put together within the time given.

##### Notes
The graphing portion of this was inspired by the tutorial [HERE](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/responsive-bar-charts-bokeh-flask-python-3.html)
